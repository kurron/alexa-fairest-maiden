# Overview
This project is a simple Amazon Echo application that I created just to test out Voice User Interfaces (VUI).
It based on a [sample article](https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/post/Tx3DVGG0K0TPUGQ/New-Alexa-Skills-Kit-Template:-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Build-a-Fact-Skill) written by Amazon.
